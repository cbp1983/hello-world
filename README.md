# hello-world
Greetings, earthlings!

I'm Christoffer, I've been using computers daily for 30 years but somehow avoided learning how to code.
I've worked with IT support and admin, including keeping fancy expensive simulators running.  
Now I'm studying Linux Sysadmin and preparing for the LFCS certification, and also doing a Google/Udacity Android Basics course.

Android development is proving really addictive, especially the java side of it. 
Hoping to learn more Java, then Python, and also getting AWS certified.

Have fun!
